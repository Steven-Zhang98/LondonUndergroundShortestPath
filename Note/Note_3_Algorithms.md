Underpinning our system are key technical concepts and algorithms crucial for its efficiency:

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): By employing ABCs, we ensure that our data loading mechanism is extensible, paving the way for different data sources in the future.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): The choice of BFS for path finding is no coincidence. Its ability to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs like our station network makes it the perfect fit.
