# LondonUndergroundShortestPath

## Introduction to the System
In this project, we'll explore the London Underground, the oldest underground railway network in the world. The system's complexity creates a significant need for an efficient route-finding way to help passengers find the path between stations. 

## Usage Instructions
To find the Shortest Path In the London Underground system, simply follow these steps:

Setup: Download the source code and open it with a code editor like PyCharm.

Running the Application: Execute the main.py script 

Customisation: Users can personalise their experience by modifying the stations.txt file and adjusting UI elements like fonts and backgrounds to suit their preferences.

### To-Do list
